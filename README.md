</h1>

A **code-first** agent framework for seamlessly planning and executing data analytics tasks. 
This innovative framework interprets user requests through coded snippets and efficiently 
coordinates a variety of plugins in the form of functions to execute 
data analytics tasks.

# NewsðŸ†•
- ðŸ“…2023-12-21: TaskWeaver now supports a number of LLMs, such as LiteLLM, Ollama, Gemini, and QWenðŸŽˆ.
- ðŸ“…2023-12-21: TaskWeaver Website is now [available](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/) with more documentations.
- ðŸ“…2023-12-12: A simple UI demo is available in playground/UI folder, try it [here](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/docs/usage/webui)!
<!-- - [2023-11-30] TaskWeaver is released on GitHubðŸŽˆ.  -->


## Highlights

- [x] **Rich data structure** - TaskWeaver allows you to work with rich data structures in Python, such as DataFrames, instead of dealing with strings.
- [x] **Customized algorithms** - TaskWeaver allows you to encapsulate your own algorithms into plugins and orchestrate them.
- [x] **Incorporating domain-specific knowledge** - TaskWeaver is designed to incorporat domain-specific knowledge easily to improve the reliability.
- [x] **Stateful execution** - TaskWeaver is designed to support stateful execution of the generated code to ensure consistent and smooth user experience.
- [x] **Code verification** - TaskWeaver is designed to verify the generated code before execution. It can detect potential issues in the generated code and provide suggestions to fix them.
- [x] **Easy to use** - TaskWeaver is easy to use with sample plugins, examples and tutorials to help you get started. TaskWeaver offers an open-box experience, allowing users to run it immediately after installation.
- [x] **Easy to debug** - TaskWeaver is easy to debug with detailed and transparent logs to help you understand the entire process, including LLM prompts, the code generation, and execution process.
- [x] **Security consideration** - TaskWeaver supports a basic session management to keep different users' data separate. The code execution is separated into different processes to avoid mutal interference.
- [x] **Easy extension** - TaskWeaver is easy to extend to accomplish more complex tasks with multiple agents as the plugins.

## Quick Start

### Installation
TaskWeaver requires **Python >= 3.10**. It can be installed by running the following command:
```bash
# [optional to create conda environment]
# conda create -n taskweaver python=3.10
# conda activate taskweaver

# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver.git
cd TaskWeaver
# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Configure the LLMs
Before running TaskWeaver, you need to provide your LLM configurations. Taking OpenAI as an example, you can configure `taskweaver_config.json` file as follows. 

#### OpenAI
```json
{
"llm.api_key": "the api key",
"llm.model": "the model name, e.g., gpt-4"
}
```

ðŸ’¡ TaskWeaver also supports other LLMs and advanced configurations, please check the [documents](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/docs/overview) for more details. 

### Start TaskWeaver

#### 1. Command Line Interaction
```bash
# assume you are in the cloned TaskWeaver folder
python -m taskweaver -p ./project/
```
This will start the TaskWeaver process and you can interact with it through the command line interface. 
If everything goes well, you will see the following prompt:

```
=========================================================

=========================================================
TaskWeaver: I am TaskWeaver, an AI assistant. To get started, could you please enter your request?
Human: ___
```

#### 2. Web UI 
TaskWeaver also supports WebUI for demo purpose, please refers to [web UI docs](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/docs/usage/webui) for more details.

#### 3. Import as a Library
TaskWeaver can be imported as a library to integrate with your existing project, more information can be found in [docs](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver/docs/usage/library)

## Documentation
More documentations can be found on [TaskWeaver Website](https://microsoft.github.io/TaskWeaver).

## Demo Examples



#### Example 1: Pull data from a database and apply an anomaly detection algorithm
In this example, we will show you how to use TaskWeaver to pull data from a database and apply an anomaly detection algorithm.

[Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver/assets/7489260/9f854acf-f2bf-4566-9d16-f84e915d0f4e)

If you want to follow this example, you need to configure the `sql_pull_data` plugin in the `project/plugins/sql_pull_data.yaml` file.
You need to provide the following information:
```yaml
api_type: azure or openai
api_base: ...
api_key: ...
api_version: ...
deployment_name: ...
sqlite_db_path: sqlite:///../../../sample_data/anomaly_detection.db
```
The `sql_pull_data` plugin is a plugin that pulls data from a database. It takes a natural language request as input and returns a DataFrame as output.

This plugin is implemented based on [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/).
If you want to follow this example, you need to install the Langchain package:
```bash
pip install langchain
pip install tabulate
```

#### Example 2: Forecast QQQ's price in the next week
In this example, we will show you how to use TaskWeaver to forecast QQQ's price in the next week using the ARIMA algorithm. 

[Nasdaq 100 Index Price Forecasting](https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver/assets/7489260/c2b09615-52d8-491f-bbbf-e86ba282e59a)

If you want to follow this example, you need to you have two requirements installed:
```bash
pip install yfinance
pip install statsmodels
```

For more examples, please refer to our [paper](http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2311.17541). 

> ðŸ’¡ The planning of TaskWeaver are based on the LLM model. Therefore, if you want to repeat the examples, the execution process may be different
> from what you see in the videos. Typically, more concrete prompts will help the model to generate better plans and code.
